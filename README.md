# Dice Roller App

The motivation for this project was a board game called 'Catan'. While playing with friends we noticed that if not timed, people's turns could stretch for way too long, extending the total games duration and causng frustration among players.

To facilitate, the main function of the app is giving the dice results (removing the need of phisical dices). Once the dices are thrown, a 2 minutes timer starts counting down, which is how long the person that has thrown the dices has to finish thier play. Also, each time the dices are thrown their results are saved into a state variable and displayed in a 'Results History' tables, where each past result is saved and the percentage of time that specific number was achieved is shown.
